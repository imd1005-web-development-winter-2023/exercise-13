# Exercise 13 - Building a search page

For this exercise, let's continue practicing using flex box and CSS. This time we're going to build an actual search page using flexbox. This exercise builds on the work that we did in Exercise 12. All of the colour codes you need are in your `style.css` file, though you can use a different colour palette if you are so inclined. All of the images that you need are in the `images` folder as well.

## Desired outcome

## Steps

Grab the HTML and CSS files in the main project folder and modify both the `style.css` file and the `index.html` until you acheive the desired outcome. In this exercise you must modify the main HTML file to acheive the desired outcome. Please note that you should not be editing the CSS reset file.
